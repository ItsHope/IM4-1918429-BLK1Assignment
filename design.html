                    <h1>Design Rationale</h1>
                    <p class="webinfo"><em>
                        For my website I knew that I wanted to display Jack Stauber's art but I wanted to do it in a creative way. Jack Stauber has always inspired me and if I wanted to feature his art I had already set a high standard for myself. Through planning I realized that I could not necessarily be as free as I wanted to because his art is different, out-of-the-box and unconventional.So if I wanted to create a website that was in theme with his art style, I would have to be breaking a lot of web design rules. That is the first mistake I made with my initial design. I had designed a home page that had a full background photo of Opal and had a flickering effect. That was in theme but just too much, the flickering was too much and it would go on every time a user moved the cursor. I also had ideas that were going to push boundaries like an upside down nav bar, and kinetic elements such as a floating footer. I quickly had to realize how this was going to be a problem because as much as I wanted my users to have an experience, I also wanted them to be able to know how to use the website.

                        I had to choose between wanting to display his art and wanting to recreate a website inspired by his art because I could not do both. I leaned towards showcasing his art. My website can still can be considered as different and daring because I've done a lot of things different.

                         <p class="webinfo"><em>
                            I don't have the conventional navigation bar at the top of the page that I usually have instead my navigation is reliant on the square at the left top side of the page that animates into a longer bar with all of the buttons to the other pages. This element also features Jack's art. One distinctive thing about his art is the way he draws his eyes on his characters hence the logo. Another element that I included in my website to stay in theme with the art style includes the text that reads "I cannot look away" on the home page. I animated that text in a way that was surreal, horror like and add some mystery and spookiness. Opal is considered a horror film and was released on Halloween. The home page also has a picture of Opal, that gets brighter on hover. This I made to create an element of revealing his art. I feel like next Jack Stauber has made a name for himself in the art industry but at the same time a lot of people don't know him and it's only a certain people that have warmed up to his art style and music so that is why I wanted my website to feel like an introduction or discovery of him through Opal. This links me to the door element on the homepage, the door acts as a button to the internet artwork page, so as you hover over the door to open it and click on it, you enter the world of Jack Stauber's art. The blogs page has post cards that feature some of his drawings he has made, some outside Opal.

                            <p class="webinfo"><em>
                                In my design rationale I mentioned how I did not consider other design choices because I wanted to ensure my website followed basic web design conventions. This brings me to talk about the good UI and UX considerations that were made for my website. To start off with UI, one of the things I was intentional about was the white or negative space in my website. Most if not all elements have a decent distance between each other. I would describe Jack's Art as a bit chaotic and there's a lot to look at. I ensured that my website didn't affect that experience of viewing his art by being clustered and the whole thing being an overload to look at. The colourway chosen for the whole blog was also intentional. Dark and the colour black are colours that I felt did not take away from the art and allow the art to be the main thing in the pages it is featured in. Some of my pages include a gradient to compliment the colour of the images and a distressed kind of look. This gradient through is still very subtle. Some responsiveness was implemented throughout the website. There is  consistency with the colours used in my website. All font is white, the navigation bar remains at the top left of the page in all the pages that require it. All the animations made in the website excluding the main net art were implemented for the theme of the website as well as for aesthetics.

                             <p class="webinfo"><em>
                                To move on to the UX, the user experience. I have asked my family members to use my blog and all of them were able to figure out that the door animation is a button. If a user cannot, there is text that suggest that the door is a button. The door also hovers like a button which suggests interactivity. After clicking on it, users are taken to the internet art page. If a user does not figure that out, the nav bar has a button for the internet artwork page. There are two ways to get to it. My pages with text or pages that are long have a scroll bar for better navigation. The navigation bar is sticky which means users do not have to scroll up the page to access it.

                    <h2>Internet Artwork -Explanation,Preparation and Technical Concerns</h2>
                    <p class="webinfo"><em>
                        My idea for my internet art was to create a gallery that showcases Jack Stauber's Opal, but I wanted to give the user an idea of the film and tell the story through images, music and text. I feel I have achieved that with my prototype, there is still a lot of room for improvement. My internet art is a page on my website that aims to show the film. The page has the elements â€“ video, imagery, music and text. After a user lands on the page, they are first met with a gif of Opal looking distressed. I have a disclaimer over the image because I understand sensitive topics are being discussed below. There is then a passage that gives a summary of the film and finally the swinging gallery.  The reading "Design principles for interactive user experience through net art" by Ji Yong Park explains how " The essence of a net art is that it is highly experimental and pushes the boundaries of communication, cultural criticism and technology (Greene 2004) as sited in Park. For my net art I came to this statement a lot, I already knew I wanted to communicate a film to a user and it was going to be communicated through imagery and image. The swinging gallery has photos swinging that were taken from the film. As the user reads the passage, they can familiarize themselves with the characters in the film, they can envision the rest of the film and characters. This is also through the help of music, as they go through the home page, pieces of what the music may look like come to mind. I feel I was able to execute that. Another big thing I wanted was interactivity. The user can interact with the gallery by freezing one image at a time to get a closer look. I took note on all the UI and UX when it comes to net art using the guide "Interaction Design - IA, UI and UX". Namely the colours used for the gallery, my main colour is white which is very neutral. The font is readable and white on a black background. My net art includes input controls. The user can play and pause music, they can also control the volume.  

Although I am happy with the outcome of my net art. There is still a lot of room for improvement. I can turn the music player into a radio using CSS. I wanted to do that already, but I am still facing technical problems. All the ideas I have need me to have stronger coding skills. I find that I need to do research outside of the language I'm used to. I should consider learning SCSS if I want to include a drawing pad in my final website. I plan to give the user a chance to create unapologetically, even if it is not traditional.
