            <p class="text">The Javascript videos personally helped me. I took down notes and had a lot of aha moments about what Javascript is and how it works. There were confusing parts that I will continue to go through. I know its going to take a lot of practice to fully get familiar with the fundamentals and it will pay off when its time to create my web art as I have been drawn to art that is going to need me to have somewhat strong coding skills. I really really loved Khutso Nkadimeng's internet art that explored the ideas of internet geopolitics and access. 

                I found the readings interesting and the concept of web art interesting in general. I'm a fan of the internet. I think humans are brilliant for the internet and anything that is good becomes better with the internet or rather has potential to. In The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet by David, he speaks on how today, the original artifact matters less than the reproductions.  "You see the work better – that is, closer, in more detail – online than in person" (Carrier, 202). I watched an online gallery once during the national lockdown and the experience was beautiful. I was immersed because of the music, the special effects etc.  
               
                
               
               I do feel like the net art that I looked at felt more like a system that you give an input to get an output. It didn’t feel and look like art. This is why I also loved Iman Raffee's work because of the colours. I've always associated art with colour and something grabbing your attention. I now know that my two emphasis for my internet art are responsiveness when the user interacts with it and a theme of having a range of colours. I'm excited to see what to create from those two standpoints

                <p class="text"> The API videos were informative, the real test for full understanding will be me actually working with API's and extracting data or even more advanced live data online. Getting these concepts and JavaScript in general is going to require real consistent practice, at least that's how I learn. I have though made a lot of progress in my skills.  

                    Week 4's reading was interesting. Steven Mailloux discusses the concept of convention and context in literature deeply, which made me think about conventions in general and my understanding of them. One part of the paper that I found interesting was his discussion of the theorist, Bert O. States. States explains how traditional conventions are established, "through observation of an innovative practice", he claims that the innovative shocks the audience and even the medium. (States as quoted in Mailloux, 1983). This brings about adoption of the practice if the other artists adopt the practice. This was interesting to me because of the "if", it meant that conventions relied on unity. Paul Alpers another theorist, revealed in his thesis that "convening reminds us that conventions describe individuals coming together". If other artists do not adopt the innovative practice, there will not be a new convention, there is no guarantee, it's all by chance unless a prescriptive convection. This reliance on unity, for me further emphasized the definition Mailloux gave at the beginning of the paper. Conventions refer to "shared practices".  
                    
                    Prescriptive conventions though,mean the community in question is put pressure on to follow a certain way of doing things, but outside of literature, how? Is this done legally? These are the questions I was left with. Through the examples made in Mailloux's commentary, I agree that context is significant in both traditional convention and prescriptive convention. Both explanatory concepts are context specific. The reading helped me also think about conventions within web art like interactivity and conventions within web design like navbar placements etc.  
                    
                    Going through internet art that was provided and doing research in general, I am finding a lot of art I like and drawing inspiration and gaining confidence as I get better coding skills. I am still stuck on colourful visuals and meaning interaction for my internet art.

                    <h3 class="title">Blog3 (Analysis of an Internet Artwork)</h3> 
    
                     
    
                     <p class="text">  My choice of net/web art to analyze is Indirect Flights. This piece of art is one I had to grow to understand. At first glance it is chaotic and hard to make out of. But like what internet art means, the tools that the internet offers make it better. If I would, I would say the internet tools give it an aura. Benjamin describes the aura as “a phenomena’s uniqueness” (Benjamin, 2015). His theory suggests that every original piece of art has an aura, for example, “the aura of the sunset, the aura of nature” (Benjamin, 2015) that cannot be replaced. Therefore, mechanically or technologically reproduced art refuses to appreciate or acknowledge that aura. I arguably suggest that internet tools give art that aura, things like interactivity and animation. Benjamin speaks on this in "The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Internet" by acknowledging the aura in netart "art on the internet still has evidence of contemplative emersion that usually is lost in mechanically reproduced art". While viewing Indirect Flight, I found myself staring like I normally would at an original artpiece. I look at every colour and every element, all the details. I will say in detail because the internet offers tools to view visuals better. “The display system has changed, you see the work better, close ups and etc.” (Carrier, 2020). A lot of my classmates and Danae argued that net art can be seen as clunky, uncool and old fashioned. I felt that for a lot of the net art I viewed, Indirect Flight can be seen as that too. I argue though that this is only the case at first glance. I don't think viewers in the 80s were able to view art like how we do. With just how clear it is, I was able to appreciate and see the creators vision, I hope. The layering of the images is so odd and captivating, and I think internet art is only going to get even better with interactivity emerging and technology improving. Net Art pieces can also be viewed with music to assist with immersion just like Indirect Flights and my Internet Artwork (The collage). That makes the experience so much better.
